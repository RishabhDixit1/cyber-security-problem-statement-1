## Introduction

The **Malware Analysis Platform** is a simulated environment designed using GNS3 to analyze malware in a secure, controlled setup. This platform enables network administrators and cybersecurity professionals to detect malicious behaviors, classify malware types, and mitigate security threats. The topology mimics a real-world network for hands-on experimentation with malware analysis.

## Features

- **Sandbox Simulation**: Isolated execution of malware in virtualized environments.
- **Traffic Monitoring**: Real-time analysis of network traffic for anomalous patterns.
- **Behavior Analysis**: Observing the impact of malicious files on victim machines.
- **Classification**: Categorization of malware using rule-based or machine learning methods.
- **Threat Mitigation**: Demonstrating techniques to neutralize identified threats.
- **Scalable Network Topology**: Flexible virtual setup using GNS3 and virtual machines.

## System Topology

### Components:
1. **Attacker Node**: Kali Linux VM running tools like Metasploit for malware deployment.
2. **Victim Node**: Windows VM used to simulate malware infection.
3. **Network Monitoring**: Wireshark for traffic capture and analysis.
4. **Sandbox Environment**: Configured using GNS3 virtual appliances.
5. **Router and Switches**: Virtual devices to replicate network communication.

### Visual Representation:
A network topology comprising:
- **Kali VM**: Malware injection and traffic generation.
- **Windows VM**: Victim machine to observe infection.
- **Router/Switches**: Simulating an enterprise network.
- **Analyzer Node**: Monitoring network traffic and file behavior.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- **GNS3**: Installed on the host machine.
- **GNS3 VM**: Configured with sufficient resources.
- **Kali Linux VM**: For simulating attacks.
- **Windows VM**: For victim simulations.
- **Wireshark**: For traffic analysis.
- **Metasploit Framework**: For deploying malware.

### Steps to Set Up:
1. **Import GNS3 Appliances**:
   - Download and import the required VMs (Kali, Windows) and appliances into GNS3.
2. **Create the Topology**:
   - Set up the network with routers, switches, and virtual machines.
3. **Configure Nodes**:
   - Assign IPs and ensure connectivity between nodes.
4. **Install Tools**:
   - Install Metasploit, Wireshark, and other required tools on respective nodes.
5. **Verify Topology**:
   - Test connectivity and ensure the setup is functional.

## Simulation Workflow

1. **Initiate Malware Attack**:
   - Use the Kali VM to deploy a malware payload using Metasploit.
2. **Analyze Network Traffic**:
   - Capture and monitor traffic using Wireshark on the analyzer node.
3. **Observe Victim Behavior**:
   - Monitor changes on the Windows VM (e.g., file encryption, system performance).
4. **Classify Malware**:
   - Analyze behaviors and classify the malware type manually or using scripts.
5. **Mitigation**:
   - Demonstrate steps to neutralize the malware (e.g., disconnecting nodes, applying patches).
6. **Generate Reports**:
   - Use captured logs and traffic data to create a detailed analysis report.

## Tools and Technologies Used

- **GNS3**: Simulation and topology design.
- **VirtualBox/VMware**: Virtual machine management.
- **Kali Linux**: Attack simulation using Metasploit.
- **Windows VM**: Victim machine for infection testing.
- **Wireshark**: Packet analysis and traffic monitoring.
- **Python**: Automation and scripting (if applicable).
- **Metasploit Framework**: Malware deployment.

## Future Enhancements

- Automate malware classification using machine learning.
- Integrate external threat intelligence feeds for real-time analysis.
- Extend to include Linux-based victim nodes.
- Add advanced malware mitigation techniques like Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS).
